# PitchPerfect
**Udacity iOS Nanodegree project1**

The Pitch Perfect app allows users to record a sound using the device’s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with four different sound modulations: Chipmunk, Darth Vader, Super Slow, and Super Fast.
The app has two view controller scenes.
- Record Sounds View: Allows users to record a sound. 
- Play Sounds View: Allows users to play the recorded sound back with effects.

The play sounds view will have been pushed onto the navigation stack. At the top left of the screen, the navigation bar’s left button says “Record”. Clicking this button will pop the play sounds view off the stack and return the user to the record sounds view.
